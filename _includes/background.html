      I'm currently a senior student at
      <strong>Omar Bin Al-Khattab highschool</strong> finishing off a journey of 12 years with some awesome people.

      In the mix of 
      <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Filmmaking</strong>, I love soaking up knowledge and often land top grades. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not just about coding; I dig into filmmaking, storytelling, and critiquing. I'm friendly but also a bit picky when it comes to my work. Team projects light me up, making tough stuff way easier. Whether coding or storytelling, I'm always curious, asking why and how.

    <p>
      Learning isn't just a skill; it's a habit, even in video games.    
    </p>
    <p>
      My big aim? Turn what I learn into a positive contribution for a better world.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm writing, directing, and filming my ideas.</strong>
